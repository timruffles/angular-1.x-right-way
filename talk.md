## the cycle of hope and hopes crushed

- programmer burned out
- plays with new framework
- oh it gets it all so right! toy project so pretty
- convinces team, builds project
- oh look, real projects are complex
- codebase scary
- repeat 

##Â Angular

- a new hope for web development
- turns out, web apps still hard
- here are some tips to get the most out of angular

## a firm foundation

- deep wisdom in MVC
- layering in GUIs works pretty well
- so be strict from the start

## use directives > controllers

- explicit arguments
- controllerAs + bindToController

## data-flow

- routes
- controllers
- views

## avoid singletons

- instant fragility

## avoid the module-system

- complexity without payoff
- sinon etc
- DI what you need to

## browserify

- fast, neat
- same as backend

## using isolates properly

- big level up in angular understanding

## use ngmodel controller

- keep form logic separate

## split out persistence

### active-record: bad idea or worst idea ever?

- AR for CRUD, nowt else
- expose data layer with named functions
  - easy to refactor
  - easy to understand


## structure around features

```sh
/src
  /features
    /booking
      index.html
      index.js
      booking-search.js
      booking-search.html
      style.css
    /account
      ...
  /components
    /nav-bar
      index.js
      index.html
    /profile-widget
      ...
```

## write up a framework

- conventions
- high level routes

## go for FP

- data munging
- composes

## write small objects

- write simple things

## be explicit

- don't be clever
- sinking feeling when things break
