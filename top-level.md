  angular didn't make web-dev easy

1. angular wasn't going to do it for me
  1. too small
    1. structure
    2. abstraction
  2. even decisions to not use bits of angular
    1. module system
    1. resource
  3. especially if I don't use it all
    1. because documentation is hard
    1. directives
    1. ng model controller
